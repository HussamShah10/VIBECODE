What did you build?
**I built a gambling game that is based in a classroom. You can play one of 2 games and have to get to $50k to win.**
What language(s) or tools did you use?
**My code was a half-and-half mix of Python, CSS, and HTML. I only used ChatGPT for the whole project.**
Which AI tools did you use, and how?
**I used ChatGPT to give me the starting code. Then I added games like slots and a game where you and your classmate roll a die. Whoever has the highest count rolled wins. I also used ChatGPT to help me incorporate Python into a website and make it itself.**
What did you do versus what AI helped with?
**I did most of the slots game. AI helped me with the weight of the slots where the higher prices were harder to get, as I had no clue how to do that.**
What’s one thing you’re proud of?
**The fact that I wanted to do a lot, but I didn't let scope creep get to me. I started with a small game and slowly added different pieces to it which helped me have a product to turn in if one of the additions didn't work.**
What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
**I would switch the Python over to JS and maybe add some more fun games. Also delete system42 if you lose all the money.**
